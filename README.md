# About this project 
## Overview
This project follows the complete data science pipeline to analyse and classify Italian wines based on their chemical properties. The dataset contains chemical analysis results from wines grown in the same region of Italy, with thirteen different components measured for each wine type.

## Dataset
The Wine dataset includes chemical analysis of wines from three different cultivars grown in the same Italian region. The thirteen measured attributes represent the fundamental chemical characteristics that define each wine's unique profile.

## Historical Context
Wine production dates back nearly 6000 B.C. to ancient civilisations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The craft has evolved significantly over millennia, with Italy becoming the world's leading wine producer since 2014. Whilst wines from different regions typically vary in taste, aroma, and body due to climate, soil, and winemaking techniques, the wines in this dataset share a common regional origin, making their chemical differences particularly interesting to study.

## Research Question
Can we accurately classify wines by their cultivar based solely on their chemical composition?
This investigation explores whether the chemical components of wine differ sufficiently to distinguish between varieties produced in the same geographic area.

## Methodology
The project follows the standard data science pipeline:
Question Formulation - Defining the classification problem
Data Collection & Preparation - Loading and cleaning the wine dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis - Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations between chemical attributes
Model Development - Building and training classification models (including Decision Trees)
Model Evaluation - Assessing performance using confusion matrices and relevant metrics
Communication - Presenting results through visualisations and clear interpretation

## Key Features
Comprehensive exploratory data analysis of wine chemical properties
Correlation analysis between the thirteen chemical components
Implementation of machine learning classification models
Performance evaluation using confusion matrices
Clear visualisations and interpretations throughout

## Results
The analysis demonstrates the relationship between chemical composition and wine classification, providing insights into how different chemical attributes contribute to distinguishing between wine varieties from the same Italian region.
